Based on its experience during this period, the Secret Service now recommends that additional personnel be made available to PRS
so that these arrangements can be made permanent without adversely affecting the operations of the Services field offices.
The Commission regards this as a most useful innovation and urges that the practice be continued.
Liaison With Local Law Enforcement Agencies
Advice by the Secret Service to local police in metropolitan areas relating to the assistance expected in connection with a Presidential visit
has hitherto been handled on an informal basis.
The Service should consider preparing formal explanations of the cooperation anticipated during a Presidential visit to a city,
in formats that can be communicated to each level of local authorities.
Thus, the local chief of police could be given a master plan, prepared for the occasion, of all protective measures to be taken during the visit;
each patrolman might be given a prepared booklet of instructions explaining what is expected of him. The Secret Service has expressed concern
that written instructions might come into the hands of local newspapers, to the prejudice of the precautions described.
However, the instructions must be communicated to the local police in any event and can be leaked to the press whether or not they are in writing.
More importantly, the lack of carefully prepared and carefully transmitted instructions for typical visits to cities
can lead to lapses in protection, such as the confusion in Dallas about whether members of the public were permitted on overpasses.
Such instructions will not fit all circumstances, of course,
and should not be relied upon to the detriment of the imaginative application of judgment in special cases.
Inspection of Buildings
Since the assassination of President Kennedy, the Secret Service has been experimenting with new techniques in the inspection of buildings along a motorcade route.
According to Secretary Dillon,
the studies indicate that there is some utility in attempting to designate certain buildings as involving a higher risk than others.
The Commission strongly encourages these efforts to improve protection along a motorcade route.
The Secret Service should utilize the personnel of other Federal law enforcement offices
in the locality to assure adequate manpower for this task, as it is now doing.
Lack of adequate resources is an unacceptable excuse for failing to improve advance precautions
in this crucial area of Presidential protection.
Secret Service Personnel and Facilities
Testimony and other evidence before the Commission
suggest that the Secret Service is trying to accomplish its job with too few people and without adequate modern equipment.
Although Chief Rowley does not complain about the pay scale for Secret Service agents,
salaries are below those of the FBI and leading municipal police forces.
The assistant to the Director of the FBI testified that
the caseload of each FBI agent averaged 20 to 25, and he felt that this was high.
Chief Rowley testified that the present workload of each Secret Service agent averages 110.1 cases.
While these statistics relate to the activities of Secret Service agents stationed in field offices and not the White House detail,
field agents supplement those on the detail, particularly when the President is traveling.
Although the Commission does not know whether the cases involved are entirely comparable,
these figures suggest that the agents of the Secret Service are substantially overworked.
In its budget request for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1964,
the Secret Service sought funds for 25 new positions, primarily in field offices. This increase has been approved by the Congress.
Chief Rowley explained that this would not provide enough additional manpower to take all the measures which he considers required.
However, the 1964 to 65 budget request was submitted in November 1963
and requests for additional personnel were not made because of the studies then being conducted.
The Secret Service has now presented its recommendations to the Bureau of the Budget. The plan proposed by the Service
would take approximately 20 months to implement and require expenditures of approximately $3,000,000 during that period.
The plan provides for an additional 205 agents for the Secret Service. Seventeen of this number are proposed for the Protective Research Section;
145 are proposed for the field offices to handle the increased volume of security investigations
and be available to protect the President or Vice President when they travel;
18 agents are proposed for a rotating pool which will go through an intensive training cycle and also be available to supplement the White House detail
in case of unexpected need; and 25 additional agents are recommended to provide the Vice President full protection.
The Commission urges that the Bureau of the Budget review these recommendations with the Secret Service and authorize a request for the necessary supplemental appropriation,
as soon as it can be justified. The Congress has often stressed that it will support any reasonable request for funds for the protection of the President.
Manpower and Technical Assistance From Other Agencies
Before the assassination the Secret Service infrequently requested other Federal law enforcement agencies to provide personnel
to assist in its protection functions.
Since the assassination, the Service has experimented with the use of agents borrowed for short periods from such agencies.
It has used other Treasury law enforcement agents on special experiments in building and route surveys in places to which the President frequently travels.
It has also used other Federal law enforcement agents during Presidential visits to cities in which such agents are stationed.
Thus, in the 4 months following the assassination,
the FBI, on 16 separate occasions, supplied a total of 139 agents to assist in protection work during a Presidential visit,
which represents a departure from its prior practice.
From February 11 through June 30, 1964,
the Service had the advantage of 9,500 hours of work by other enforcement agencies.
The FBI has indicated that it is willing to continue to make such assistance available,
even though it agrees with the Secret Service that it is preferable for the Service to have enough agents to handle all protective demands.
The Commission endorses these efforts to supplement the Services own personnel by obtaining, for short periods of time,
the assistance of trained Federal law enforcement officers.
In view of the ever-increasing mobility of American Presidents, it seems unlikely that the Service could or should increase its own staff to a size
which would permit it to provide adequate protective manpower for all situations.
The Commission recommends that the agencies involved determine how much periodic assistance they can provide, and that each such agency
and the Secret Service enter into a formal agreement defining such arrangements.
It may eventually be desirable to codify the practice in an Executive order.
The Secret Service will be better able to plan its own long-range personnel requirements if it knows with reasonable certainty
the amount of assistance that it can expect from other agencies.
The occasional use of personnel from other Federal agencies to assist in protecting the President has a further advantage. It symbolizes the reality
that the job of protecting the President has not been and cannot be exclusively the responsibility of the Secret Service.
The Secret Service in the past has sometimes guarded its right to be acknowledged as the sole protector of the Chief Executive.
This no longer appears to be the case.
Protecting the President is a difficult and complex task which requires full use of the best resources of many parts of our Government.
Recognition that the responsibility must be shared increases the likelihood that it will be met.
Much of the Secret Service work requires the development and use of highly sophisticated equipment,
some of which must be specially designed to fit unique requirements. Even before the assassination, and to a far greater extent thereafter,
the Secret Service has been receiving full cooperation in scientific research and technological development
from many Government agencies including the Department of Defense and the Presidents Office of Science and Technology.
Even if the manpower and technological resources of the Secret Service are adequately augmented,
it will continue to rely in many respects upon the greater resources of the Office of Science and Technology and other agencies.
The Commission recommends that the present arrangements
with the Office of Science and Technology and the other Federal agencies that have been so helpful to the Secret Service be placed on a permanent and formal basis.
The exchange of letters dated August 31, 1964,
between Secretary Dillon and Donald F. Hornig, Special Assistant to the President for Science and Technology, is a useful effort in the right direction.
The Service should negotiate a memorandum of understanding with each agency that has been assisting it and from which it can expect to need help in the future.
The essential terms of such memoranda might well be embodied in an Executive order.
This Commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our Presidents which will guarantee security.
The demands on the President in the execution of His responsibilities in todays world are so varied and complex
and the traditions of the office in a democracy such as ours are so deep-seated as to preclude absolute security.
The Commission has, however, from its examination of the facts of President Kennedys assassination
made certain recommendations which it believes would, if adopted,
materially improve upon the procedures in effect at the time of President Kennedys assassination and result in a substantial lessening of the danger.
As has been pointed out, the Commission has not resolved all the proposals which could be made. The Commission nevertheless is confident that,
with the active cooperation of the responsible agencies and with the understanding of the people of the United States in their demands upon their President,
the recommendations we have here suggested would greatly advance the security of the office without any impairment of our fundamental liberties.
