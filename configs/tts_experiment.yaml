    name: Speech synthesis evaluation
    content: Hi, welcome to this speech synthesis survey. My name is Jan Vainer and
      I need your help! In my thesis, I tried to develop a high-quality speech synthesis
      system. But before submitting the thesis, the system needs a quality evaluation.
      Please evaluate the following sentence recordings according to perceived quality
      and speech fluency. On each page, you will be presented with 5 recordings of
      the same sentence. One recording is synthesized from my system, three recordings
      are synthesized from other systems and the last recording is a human speaker.
      The recordings are randomly shuffled. There will be 10 pages in total.
